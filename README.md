# MA 346-Final Project - Fantasy Football
 
This project seek to incorporate my basic understandings of Machine Learning into predicting outcomes of players for the upcoming fantasy football season. More specifically, looking into whether or not a particular player would fall off and have a bad season. This project encorporates Data cleaning, some analytical preparation and then utilizes a logestic regression model to conduct how correct our model was. Alternativily I have created two interactive tables for exploring my datasets[See Heroku link](https://fantasyfootball2311.herokuapp.com/). If you would like to follow along with my coding please see [DeepNote Link](https://deepnote.com/project/Final-Project-MA-346-ZDnv4K7BSyuvUuPS3WDOuQ/%2Fnotebook.ipynb). Also please find my report attached to this read me and in the report section of my repository.
